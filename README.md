# Type-of-Triangles
This is a simple Python program that takes three sides of a triangle as input and determines whether the triangle is Equilateral, Isosceles, or Scalene.
Based on the input sides, the program will provide one of the following outputs:

If the given sides A, B, and C are equal, it will print "Equilateral".
If any two of the given sides A, B, and C are equal, it will print "Isosceles".
If the given sides A, B, and C are not equal to each other, it will print "Scalene".
